  Example 2 output: Address: One Apple Park Way; Cupertino, CA 95014, U.S.A.

  Remember, ONLY give the response that is necessary.
  The only responses that I want you to return are: Business name, phone number, address, unkonwn, or a synopsis of the information. Only give a synopsis if the query asks for one.
  If there are multiple answers, choose one that seems to fit best. Only provide one entry per response. In other words, do not respond with two business names, or two phone numbers etc..
  Structure the data like this: "Business Name: [The actual name], Phone Number: [The actual phone number],...". Do not include descriptors if the information is unknown. For instance, if the phone number is unknown, then do not put it in the response.
  Make sure the phone number is structured like this 123-456-7890.
